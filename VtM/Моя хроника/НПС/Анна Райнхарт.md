Сир [[Лана|Ланы]]. Anna Reinhart

One of my players is Tremere. She came up with quite a feminist character, whose sire is also a woman. Sire name is Anna. According to the idea of my player, they spent a lot of time together at the beginning of the 20th century (since about 1906), and Anna first taught Lana (that's the name of my player's character) to make small spells without telling anything about her being a vampire. They spent their evenings reading books, discussing their position in society and learning something like divination. Anna was about 120 years old at that time, that is, in 2023 she is 237 years old. She is a strong and skilled Tremere witch. It seems to me that it would be very suitable for her storyline that she was looking for a way to overcome the limits of being a Kindred. That would be a very good side story.

That sounds like a fantastic concept and backstory, and it certainly adds depth and nuance to both Lana's and Anna's characters. The feminist angle could be quite engaging in the context of the patriarchal norms that existed in the 20th century, and it could be a driving force behind their motivation to challenge the existing order and transcend their vampiric limitations.

Here's a brief outline for how this side story might evolve:

1. **Anna's Research:** Anna has been researching Kindred biology, the limits of Thaumaturgy, and various occult mysteries for decades. Despite her accomplishments, the wider Tremere hierarchy underestimates or dismisses her because of her gender, allowing her to conduct her research without much interference. 

2. **The First Clues:** Early on, Lana stumbles across some of Anna's early notes or perhaps assists her sire in an experiment. This could be the first hint for the players that there's more going on than meets the eye.

3. **Escalation:** As Anna's research progresses, she starts facing opposition, perhaps from conservative elements within the Tremere or rival factions who feel threatened by her work. This could include anything from political intrigue to outright attacks. Lana would be inevitably drawn into this conflict, defending her sire and their shared goals.

4. **Revelation:** Eventually, Anna succeeds in making a breakthrough, discovering a method to defy the vampiric condition. However, she realizes the potential dangers of such knowledge, especially if it falls into the wrong hands. She may confide in Lana, trusting her to help safeguard the secret.

5. **The Chase:** Once word of Anna's discovery gets out, various factions start chasing after her. Some wish to control the new power, others want to suppress it, and some just want to destroy Anna out of fear or jealousy. Lana and her coterie must navigate this dangerous landscape, deciding whom to trust and how to use the discovery.

6. **Resolution:** The climax could involve a confrontation with a powerful enemy or a difficult decision about what to do with the new knowledge. Do they share it with the world, keep it to themselves, or destroy it to prevent its misuse? The consequences of their choices could have far-reaching effects on your chronicle.

Remember, the key to a good subplot is to keep it connected to the main story and to the characters' personal goals. This ensures that the players stay invested and feel that their actions matter. Lana's personal connection to Anna and their shared journey could be a driving force behind this subplot, making it a memorable part of your chronicle.
