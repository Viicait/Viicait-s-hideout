These are your vampire’s supernatural powers. See the list of Disciplines on p. 62. 
Choose two of your clan Disciplines. Put two dots in one and one dot in the other. 
For Caitiff, choose any two Disciplines. Put two dots in one and one dot in the other. 
Pick one power from each Discipline level you have, for a total of one power per dot (V:tM, pp. 244–287, and pp. 69-106). You can exchange a power of higher level for one lower, but not vice versa. (A character with two dots in a Discipline can take one level 1 power and one level 2, or they can take two level 1 powers. They cannot take two level 2 powers, however.) 
Thin-bloods have no intrinsic Disciplines, but can put a dot in Thin-Blood Alchemy if they take the Thin-blood Alchemist Merit (V:tM, p. 184)
