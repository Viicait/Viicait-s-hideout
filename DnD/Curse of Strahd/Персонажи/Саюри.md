![[Превращение Саюри]]


### На английском: 

Sayuri was injured by a werewolf on the way to Vallaki. Since then, the curse of lycanthropy has been developing in her. The moment of transformation: 

With the approach of the full moon, Sayuri's condition worsens. She becomes more irritable, her anger flares up more often. The party may notice her increased aggression and restlessness, and they may suspect that something is wrong with her. If they are perceptive, they may even notice that her eyes begin to glow with a slight amber hue.

On the night before the full moon, Sayuri has a vivid and terrifying nightmare. She sees herself running through the forest, hunting and killing animals. The dream seems so real that when she wakes up, she is covered in sweat, and her heart is pounding in her chest.

The next day comes the full moon, and the atmosphere becomes tense. As the evening approaches, Sayuri begins to experience an uncontrollable desire to escape from his companions and rush into the wilderness. Her senses are heightened, and she can hear sounds and smell smells that she has not felt before.

When night falls and the moon begins to rise, Sayuri's transformation begins. She feels a sudden, intense pain permeating her entire body as her bones crack and shift. Her muscles contract and grow, and her skin stretches and changes its shape. She lets out a howl of agony and terror as her body turns into a werewolf's body.

Her first transformation is painful and frightening for both Sayuri and her companions. Being a werewolf, she struggles to maintain self-awareness and control her instincts. She looks back with horror at her friends, in search of salvation. The party must find a way to help her survive this difficult experience and find a solution to her curse.

You can take this opportunity to arrange an exciting clash for the party. They might have to subdue Sayuri without hurting her, or find a way to keep her until morning. Alternatively, the group could find information on how to cure her of lycanthropy, which would lead them to search for a powerful cleric, druid, or other magical means to lift the curse. This can create a side quest that allows players to explore the world and find a way to help their girlfriend.
