# Backstory:

[[Каэлира Фэрроуинд|на русском]]

Kaelira Farrowind was born into the once-powerful Farrowind family, whose nobility was well-regarded in the Vale of Doumear. Over the generations, however, the Farrowind family's wealth and influence waned, their estate fell into disrepair, and they became a shadow of their former selves. Despite her noble upbringing, Kaelira was always drawn to the excitement of adventure and intrigue, feeling stifled by her family's expectations and the responsibilities that came with her title.

Secretly, Kaelira trained as a rogue and a monk, honing her skills in agility and speed, while keeping her true identity hidden from those she encountered. As she ventured further into the world, she discovered the legend of the Smoldering Blade and the return of the Furious King. Intrigued, Kaelira saw an opportunity to restore her family's honor and reclaim their lost fortune by acquiring the fabled sword for their treasury.

Motivated by a deep-seated loyalty to her family and a desire to see them rise again, Kaelira sets out on the adventure to find the Smoldering Blade. She is careful not to reveal her true intentions to her companions, fearing that they might have their own reasons for seeking the weapon.

Kaelira's character is daring and cunning, often speaking in sharp phrases and witty retorts. In combat, she relies on her agility and speed, making her a formidable opponent. Her knowledge of her family's history and the legend of the Smoldering Blade drives her to uncover the truth and secure the weapon for her family's future.

Throughout the adventure, Kaelira's motivations may be tested as she discovers the true nature of the Smoldering Blade and the dangers that come with wielding such power. Will she ultimately choose to use the sword for personal gain, or will she sacrifice her own desires for the greater good of the Vale of Doumear?

## Family

Kaelira hails from the once-prominent Farrowind family. The members of her family are as follows:

Father: Lord Eldric Farrowind Eldric is a stern, yet well-intentioned man who has tried to maintain the family's honor and nobility despite their decline in fortune. He is a skilled strategist and was once an accomplished knight. Eldric has always hoped that Kaelira would embrace her noble lineage and work to restore the family's name, but he struggles to understand her adventurous spirit and desire for independence.

Mother: Lady Elira Farrowind Elira is a graceful and compassionate woman with a talent for diplomacy. She has dedicated her life to maintaining the family's social connections and supporting their charitable endeavors. While she doesn't entirely approve of Kaelira's rebellious nature, she loves her daughter dearly and wishes for her happiness.

Older Brother: Seraphin Farrowind Seraphin is Kaelira's older brother by three years. He has taken on the responsibility of preserving the family's legacy and has become a skilled diplomat, working to secure alliances and resources to help rebuild their fortune. Despite their different paths, Seraphin and Kaelira share a close bond, with Seraphin secretly admiring his sister's adventurous spirit.

Younger Sister: Lysandra Farrowind Lysandra, Kaelira's younger sister by four years, is a talented musician and artist. She is a gentle soul, often finding solace in her creative pursuits. While she admires Kaelira's boldness, Lysandra prefers the safety and familiarity of their family estate. Kaelira feels a strong sense of protectiveness toward Lysandra, and the two sisters share a special connection.

The Farrowind family, despite their decline in fortune and power, remains fiercely loyal to one another. Each member has their own strengths and dreams, with Kaelira's quest for the Smoldering Blade representing her own unique path to restore her family's honor and secure their future.

### Fake family

When asked about her family by her companions, Kaelira presents a fabricated story to conceal her noble origins:

Kaelira: (Casually) Oh, my family? We're simple merchants from a small town called Briarwood. My father, Thomas, runs a modest blacksmith shop, specializing in horseshoes and basic tools. My mother, Mira, is a seamstress who crafts beautiful garments for the townsfolk. They're hardworking, honest people who taught me the value of determination and resourcefulness.

As for siblings, I have two. My older brother, Darren, took over the blacksmith shop from our father and is now running the business. He's skilled with a hammer and always has a kind word for everyone. My younger sister, Ivy, is a talented herbalist. She has a gift for healing and a deep connection with nature. She tends to the town's small apothecary and helps those in need.

We may not have much in terms of wealth or power, but my family has always been close-knit and supportive. They encouraged me to explore the world and make my own way, which eventually led me to this adventure.

By presenting her family as humble merchants, Kaelira creates a cover that distances her from her true noble background. This fabricated story provides her with a plausible backstory that doesn't arouse suspicion while still emphasizing the strong bond and values shared by her family members.

## Appearance

Kaelira is 23 years old, standing at 5'6" tall and weighing 130 pounds. Her appearance is striking, with an air of mystery that makes it difficult to discern her true thoughts. Her long, dark hair falls in waves past her shoulders, framing a fair and delicate face. Her almond-shaped, deep green eyes are both captivating and enigmatic, leaving others intrigued yet unable to read her intentions.

She carries herself with an elegant grace, a nod to her noble upbringing, but her fluid movements also reveal her training as a rogue and monk. Her attire is functional yet stylish, suited for both combat and social situations. Kaelira prefers dark colors, often wearing a mix of leather and cloth that allows her to blend into the shadows when necessary.

Her beauty and enigmatic presence often disarm those she encounters, allowing her to navigate social situations with ease while hiding her true motivations. Kaelira's appearance not only aids her in her quest for the Smoldering Blade but also serves as a powerful tool in her arsenal.

She would be more likely to share her motivations and emotions with others, using her charisma and warmth to build connections and alliances that could help her achieve her goals.

Despite her extroverted nature, Kaelira's loyalty to her family would remain strong, motivating her to find the Smoldering Blade and restore her family's honor and fortune. As an ESFP, she would be adaptable and resourceful, thriving on the thrill of her adventure and the connections she makes along the way.

As they spent time together, Kaelira learned from Selene the importance of balance and harmony in the world. Their passionate and intense relationship helped Kaelira grow emotionally and spiritually, but ultimately, their paths diverged as Selene felt called to protect her forest home, while Kaelira's adventurous spirit beckoned her elsewhere. Despite their separation, Kaelira holds the time they shared together close to her heart.

Guy - Roderick: A charming and roguish human thief, Roderick crossed paths with Kaelira during one of her adventures in a bustling city. They were both after the same valuable artifact, leading to a thrilling game of cat and mouse. Eventually, they decided to join forces, and their shared pursuit of excitement and danger sparked a passionate romance.

However, as their relationship deepened, Kaelira discovered that Roderick had a darker side. He was involved with a ruthless criminal organization and was willing to go to great lengths to gain power and influence. Kaelira, driven by her loyalty to her family and her own moral compass, could not accept Roderick's increasingly dangerous actions.

Their differing values and Roderick's unwillingness to change his ways ultimately led to a dramatic confrontation. The two found themselves on opposite sides of a conflict, with Kaelira trying to stop Roderick from obtaining a powerful and dangerous artifact. In the heat of battle, their feelings for each other were put to the test, and Kaelira was forced to make the difficult decision to defeat Roderick in order to protect innocent lives.

The romance ended in heartbreak and betrayal, leaving Kaelira with emotional scars that would take time to heal. Despite the pain of their parting, the experience served as a valuable lesson for Kaelira, teaching her the importance of staying true to her values and the consequences of choosing one's allegiances.

# Background

**Modified Noble Background: "Rebellious Scion"**

As a member of a once-prominent noble family, Kaelira grew up with privilege but sought to break free from the expectations that came with her lineage. She trained in secret, honing her rogue and monk skills to forge her own path. Although she doesn't flaunt her noble origins, Kaelira's upbringing has provided her with valuable knowledge and connections that she can leverage when needed.

- Skill Proficiencies: Stealth, Acrobatics

- Languages: Two of your choice (reflecting her educated upbringing)

- Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring from her family (which she keeps hidden), a small purse containing 25 gp, and a set of thieves' tools.

**Feature: Position of Privilege**

Thanks to Kaelira's noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of her. She is welcomed in high society, and common folk make every effort to accommodate her. She can secure an audience with a local noble or other authority figure if necessary, and she has a trustworthy contact who can provide her with information or assistance on her adventures.

By modifying the Noble background to include skill proficiencies and tools more in line with Kaelira's rogue and monk abilities, we create a background that reflects her unique mix of privileged upbringing and her drive for independence and adventure.
