A wandering [Perro](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Perro "Perro") monk from [Higashi](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Higashi "Higashi"), **Saga** spent most of her life in a monastery. By the time she grew up, she chose to leave for a journey throughout [Terra](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Terra "Terra") in order to see the wonders of the world with her own eyes. Along her journey in [Yan](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Yan "Yan"), she hoped to meet [an artist](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Dusk "Dusk") who once saved her master's life, and offered him an awe-inspiring scroll painting titled _Scene of Crude Mounts Utmost Risen_ which enlightened his mind. After finding shelter in a cottage on Mount Hui-ch'i from the coming winter, Saga was accidentally [trapped in a "painted world."](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Who_is_Real "Who is Real") Ever since then, she was imprisoned there for over a "decade" (according to the "painted world's" timeline) before her encounter with [Kroos](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Kroos "Kroos"), [Lava](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Lava "Lava"), and [Mr. Nothing](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Nothing "Mr. Nothing").

After the incident on Mount Hui-ch'i, Saga departed from Lava's group but somehow lost her way. She eventually reached [Rhodes Island](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Rhodes_Island "Rhodes Island") and chose to lend her aid, proving to be a capable combatant adept in _naginata-jutsu._ Though having been isolated from the outside world for a very long time, Saga has no difficulty adjusting into the current Terra, and her ardent faith often causes Saga to give off an intimidating aura when facing the unjust. However most of the time, she is a rather mellow and tranquil person.

Saga is one of the protagonists of [Who is Real](https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Who_is_Real "Who is Real").
