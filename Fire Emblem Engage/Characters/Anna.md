If you want to farm Gold with Anna and have the DLC, putting Tiki on her and making her a High Priest is one of the best ways to solo skirmishes. Not only gets she the enhanced stat growth inherited by equipping Tikis bond ring, but once maxed, she heals for 40 HP if she just waits on her turn. Giving her a maxed out Elfire with an Avoidance engraving will make her survive battles solo, and inheriting the +10 Luck/HP helps with both survivability and her passive. You'll be swimming in gold before you know it.
